ML Plot that uses public data which shows in graphical form a traditional human life pattern, 1) is just time spent alone, represented by Y axis, as you can see, after birth it gets more crowded over time, 2) then age at partnership and time spent with spouse/family, represented by X axis, which shows a clear "with family" pattern, and 3) which, as can be seen, eventuates in a very interesting oscillating pattern into old age.
